	 * This method carries out Graham's scan in several steps below: 
	 * 
	 *     1) Call the private method lowestPoint() to find the lowest point from the input 
	 *        point set and store it in the variable lowestPoint. 
	 *        
	 *     2) Call the private method setUpScan() to sort all points by polar angle with respect
	 *        to lowestPoint.  After elimination of all duplicates in points[], the points are 
	 *        stored in pointsNoDuplicate[].  Next, for multiple points having the same polar angle 
	 *        with respect to lowestPoint, keep only the one furthest from lowestPoint.  The points
	 *        after the second round of elimination are stored in the array pointsToScan[].  
	 *        
	 *     3) Perform Graham's scan on the points in the array pointsToScan[]. To initialize the 
	 *        scan, push pointsToScan[0] and pointsToScan[1] onto vertexStack.  
	 * 
     *     4) As the scan terminates, vertexStack holds the vertices of the convex hull.  Pop the 
     *        vertices out of the stack and add them to the array hullVertices[], starting at index
     *        numHullVertices - 1, and decreasing the index toward 0.  Set numHullVertices.  
     *        
     * Two special cases below must be handled: 
     * 
     *     1) The array pointsToScan[] could contain just one point, in which case the convex
     *        hull is the point itself. 
     *     
     *     2) Or it could contain two points, in which case the hull is the line segment 
     *        connecting them.
